# Flutter Geofence

A flutter geofencing plugin for flutter application (android & ios) which provides geofencing functionalities.

## Features

* Geofence event triggered on location changes
* Get continuous geofence event updates

## Usage

To add the geofence_flutter to your flutter application read the [install](https://pub.dev/packages/geofence_flutter/install) instructions. Below are some Android and iOS specifics that are required for the geofence_flutter to work correctly.

## For android

**AndroidX**

The geofence_flutter plugin requires the AndroidX version of the Android Support Libraries. This means you need to make sure your Android project supports AndroidX. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/androidx-compatibility).

The TL;DR version is:

1. Add the following to your "gradle.properties" file:

```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```
2. Make sure you set the `compileSdkVersion` in your "android/app/build.gradle" file to 33:

```
android {
  compileSdkVersion 33

  ...
}
```
3. Make sure you replace all the `android.` dependencies to their AndroidX counterparts (a full list can be found here: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate).

**Permissions**

On Android you'll need to add either the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission to your Android Manifest. To do so open the AndroidManifest.xml file (located under android/app/src/main) and add one of the following two lines as direct children of the `<manifest>` tag (when you configure both permissions the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` will be used):

``` xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

Starting from Android 10 you need to add the `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission (next to the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission) if you want to continue receiving updates even when your App is running in the background (note that the geofence_flutter plugin doesn't support receiving an processing geofence event updates while running in the background):

``` xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```

## For ios

On iOS you'll need to add the following entries to your Info.plist file (located under ios/Runner) in order to access the device's location. Simply open your Info.plist file and add the following:

``` xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location when open.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location when in the background.</string>
```

If you would like to receive updates when your App is in the background, you'll also need to add the Background Modes capability to your XCode project (Project > Signing and Capabilities > "+ Capability" button) and select Location Updates. Be careful with this, you will need to explain in detail to Apple why your App needs this when submitting your App to the AppStore. If Apple isn't satisfied with the explanation your App will be rejected.


## API

### Start Geofence Service

At first you need to start the geofence service and for that you need to pass the following parameters:

- `pointedLatitude`: the latitude of the geofence area center
- `pointedLongitude`: the longitude of the geofence area center
- `radiusMeter`: the radius of the geofence area in meters
- `eventPeriodInSeconds`: geofence event stream period in seconds

``` dart
import 'package:geofence_flutter/geofence_flutter.dart';

await Geofence.startGeofenceService(
    pointedLatitude: "52.2165157",
    pointedLongitude: "6.9437819",
    radiusMeter: "50.0",
    eventPeriodInSeconds: 10
);
```

### Get Geofence Event Streams

To get the stream geofence event updates on location changes, you need to subscribe `getGeofenceStream` to listen geofence event streams on current location updates.

``` dart
import 'package:geofence_flutter/geofence_flutter.dart';

StreamSubscription<GeofenceEvent> geofenceEventStream = Geofence.getGeofenceStream()?.listen(
  (GeofenceEvent event) {
    print(event.toString());
});
```
### Stop Geofence Service
To stop geofence service you need to specify this:

``` dart
import 'package:geofence_flutter/geofence_flutter.dart';

Geofence.stopGeofenceService();
```
Also, stop GeofenceEvent stream subscription listener which is `geofenceEventStream` in our case

``` dart
geofenceEventStream?.cancel();
```
